/*
XNET.C

Xbox Winsock and XNet for the Linux build, over BSD sockets.

Game code reaches these under the halo_ws_ names (see
halo_linux_winsock_names.h), since glibc exports its own cdecl socket(),
bind(), ... that must not be confused with the __stdcall Winsock ones.

XNet's secure addressing collapses to plain IPv4: a host's XNADDR carries its
real address, key exchange keys are random but unused, and XNADDR to
IN_ADDR translation is the identity. That is enough for system link play on
a LAN.

Two settings in config.toml's [network] (port_config.c) adjust the
addressing:

- address = "a.b.c.d" binds the game's sockets to that local address
  instead of every interface, and reports it as this machine's system link
  address. Several instances can then share one computer, each on its own
  loopback address (127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3, ...), or system link can be
  pinned to one network interface. That address then stands in for
  127.0.0.1, which the game uses for itself (a host joins its own game
  through it, and admits only it to a split screen game): connections and
  datagrams to 127.0.0.1 go to the address, and traffic from the address
  is reported as coming from 127.0.0.1.
- broadcast = "a.b.c.d[,e.f.g.h...]" sends the game's broadcasts (a
  client's system link game search, a host's game advertisement) to those
  addresses instead of 255.255.255.255, to reach machines that broadcasts
  do not: other loopback addresses, or machines across a VPN (listing
  255.255.255.255 too still broadcasts). A socket bound to one address
  receives no broadcasts, so machines with an address find each
  other only through these lists: each must list the others.

Both are read once, when the game starts its networking; a value that is
not an IPv4 address is reported and ignored.

Internet play (p2p.c) adds machines that shared an invite to this LAN: an
XNADDR's abEnet carries its machine's identifier, which XNetXnAddrToInAddr
maps to the peer's virtual address, and traffic to and from those addresses
is rewritten to and from p2p.c's local stand-ins here (or fails, with
WSAEHOSTUNREACH, while the peer is not reached). Broadcasts also go to every
peer. p2p.c is told the ports of the game's sockets, which alone peers
reach.
