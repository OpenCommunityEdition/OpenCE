/*
P2P_SIGNAL.C

Internet play's signalling (p2p.c): how a joiner and the host of an invite
tell each other where they can be reached, through public MQTT brokers
(those in brokers.txt, network.brokers_file; MQTT 5 over TCP, or 3.1.1 with
a broker that refuses 5). Every broker is used at once, so any one of them
working is enough (an answer goes back through each broker a request came
through).
They also carry the server browser's listings of public games (p2p_lobby.c):
retained in each host's slot, published at least once (QoS 1, sent again
until the broker acknowledges them), expiring at the broker after
LISTING_EXPIRY seconds (MQTT 5), and cleared by the broker if the host's
connection dies (the will every connection sets: harmless when not hosting).

A broker may drop a connection's publishes past about 10 a second without a
word (EMQX), and a host's answers to a flood of JOINs would reach that: each
broker's publishes spend from a bucket (PUBLISH_BURST at once, one more each
PUBLISH_INTERVAL). Answers to proven joiners come first, then the listing
(kept to publish later), then a joiner's requests and the browser's queries;
answers to requests not proven yet only while some are left over (the
joiner asks again).

Everything that passes through them is sealed with a key derived from the
invite's token, and goes to topics that are hashes of it, so the brokers
(and anyone watching them) learn nothing and can join nothing:

- the host listens on hceu/3/<HMAC(token, "host" | host)>, where a joiner
  sends JOIN: its public key (its identifier is the key's hash), a nonce,
  and its addresses;
- the joiner listens on hceu/3/<HMAC(token, "joiner" | joiner)>, where the
  host answers ACCEPT: its public key, the joiner's nonce, one of its own,
  its addresses, and a tag that only the two of them can make (from their
  keys);
- the joiner then repeats its JOIN with the host's nonce and a tag of its
  own, made the same way, which shows that it holds the key it gave. Only
  then does the host make a session.

Their tunnel's keys come from their X25519 shared secret and the two
nonces, and never travel: another holder of the invite reads the messages
but cannot work them out, and cannot answer as the host (whose key must
have the hash in the invite: 16 bytes, not only the identifier's 6, which
a key could be made to have). It can send a JOIN in another
machine's name, but cannot prove it: the host answers it (to that machine)
and makes no session of it. A session no one could complete would keep that
machine out while it lived (a session with a machine is not replaced while
it lives, p2p.c), and a JOIN every so often would keep it out for good.

The host's nonce is a hash of the request with a key of the host's and the
time (it changes every HOST_NONCE_PERIOD), so the host need not remember
what it answered: anyone with the invite can ask in a machine's name as
often as it likes, pushing out whatever the host remembered. What it does
keep of requests not proven yet (the work of their keys) only saves work.
It answers them sparingly, as anyone with the invite can send them from as
many keys as it likes: a request once each ANSWER_INTERVAL through each
broker, and 20 a second in all (MAXIMUM_UNPROVEN_ANSWERS), each through the
broker the request came through only (the joiner asks through them all,
again every JOIN_INTERVAL, so a broker that loses the answers keeps no
other's out).

A joiner repeats its JOIN until the tunnel reaches the host. The host makes
one session of a request (a public key and nonce) at most: anyone watching
the brokers could send the proven JOIN again after the session ended, and
have the host reach for the joiner's old addresses in its name, keeping it
out (with the same keys again). It remembers the request at least while its
host nonce lasts. So a joiner asks with a new nonce when its session with
the host ends before the tunnel reached it, or when the host has not
answered it in a while.
