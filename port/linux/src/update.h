/*
UPDATE.H

What the desktop self-updater (updater.c) needs of the system: a download
over HTTPS, and putting files in place of the running game's and starting
it again. posix_update.c does it on Linux (Mbed TLS, the system's
certificate authorities), win32_update.c on Windows (WinHTTP). The Android
app updates itself in Java (port/android).

Only integers and strings cross here: the two sides are compiled with
different structure layouts.
