/*
RAYTRACE_GL.C

Ray-traced lighting for the native ports (display.ray_tracing): rays
through the screen's depth on every port, and on macOS also rays through
the level itself with Metal (port/macos/host/host_metal_rt.m).

Once the game has drawn a window's opaque world, before its transparent
geometry, fog, effects and HUD (source/render/render.c), rays are marched
through that window's depth buffer, the scene's geometry as the camera
sees it:

- ambient occlusion: from each pixel, rays across the hemisphere around the
  surface's normal (from the depth's neighbours); what they hit close by
  darkens the pixel, as creases, corners and the ground under objects are
  in the real world;
- one bounce of indirect light: the colour a ray hits lights the pixel a
  little, so a red wall tints the floor beside it;
- reflections: a ray along the view's mirror direction; where it hits, the
  surface reflects that colour, by the Fresnel term (glancing angles
  reflect most), so floors and wet ground pick up the scene.

Rays through the screen's depth find only what the camera sees: rays
leaving the screen find nothing, and are faded out. On macOS, where Metal
can trace rays (in compute on M1 and M2, in the ray tracing hardware of the
M3 and later), the occlusion and reflections are also traced through the
level's own geometry (its collision surfaces,
port/linux/game/raytrace_world.c), which finds what the camera does not
see; the screen's rays still find the objects, which the level does not
hold. The pass costs a few milliseconds at the display's resolution.

It runs as two draws: rays into an effect texture (occlusion, reflection),
then the composite back into the window, with a depth-aware blur of the
occlusion. F9 switches it on and off while playing.
