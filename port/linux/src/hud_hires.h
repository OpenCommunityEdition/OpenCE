/*
HUD_HIRES.H

The high-res HUD: textures drawn from the hand-made SVG redraws of the Halo PC
HUD sheets (port/assets/hud, made by tools/hud_assets.py), each 8x the size
of the bitmap of the Xbox maps it stands for (4x for the largest) and in that
bitmap's layout.
tools/embed_assets.py makes them C data (hud_hires_embedded); hud_hires.c
decodes them, and the texture cache (xbox_textures.c) draws one in place of
its bitmap whenever that bitmap's pixels are uploaded: the game still sizes
and places the bitmap by its tag, so nothing else changes.
