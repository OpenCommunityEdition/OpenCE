/*
HUD_HIRES.H

The high-res HUD: textures drawn from the hand-made SVG redraws of the Halo PC
HUD sheets (port/assets/hud, made by tools/hud_assets.py), each 8x the size
of the bitmap of the Xbox maps it stands for (4x for the largest) and in that
bitmap's layout. The menus' titles, pictures of text in the maps, are drawn
the same way (port/assets/titles, made by tools/title_assets.py).
tools/embed_assets.py makes them C data (hud_hires_embedded); hud_hires.c
decodes them, and the texture cache (xbox_textures.c) draws one in place of
its bitmap whenever that bitmap's pixels are uploaded: the game still sizes
and places the bitmap by its tag, so nothing else changes.
