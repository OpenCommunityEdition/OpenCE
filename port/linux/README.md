# Linux

`ninja linux` compiles the game with clang for 32-bit x86 Linux. The result
is a native executable, `build/linux/halo`. The game shows its graphics with
OpenGL 4.5. It plays sound through SDL3. It accepts keyboard, mouse and
gamepad input.

The game is 32-bit code because its data (tags, cache files, saved games)
contains 32-bit pointers, as on the Xbox.

## Requirements

You do not need the Xbox SDK. The declarations that the game uses are in
`port/include/xdk`.

To build:

- Python and ninja.
- clang. The option `--linux-cc` of `configure.py` selects a different
  compiler.
- The 32-bit glibc development files: `lib32-glibc` on Arch Linux,
  `gcc-multilib` and `libc6-dev-i386` on Debian and Ubuntu.
- The 32-bit SDL3: `lib32-sdl3` on Arch Linux, `libsdl3-dev:i386` on Debian
  and Ubuntu. The portable build does not need it: refer to "Portable
  build".

To start the game:

- glibc 2.29 or later (32-bit), for the builds from GitHub Actions, which
  are built against glibc 2.31. They start on SteamOS 3 (Steam Deck). They
  should also start on Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 32 and later
  distributions, but this is not tested. A build that you make without
  `--portable` needs the glibc of the computer that built it, or a later
  one.
- The 32-bit OpenGL libraries (`lib32-mesa`).
- The 32-bit PipeWire or PulseAudio client libraries (`lib32-pipewire` or
  `lib32-libpulse`).
- The 32-bit X11 libraries (`lib32-libx11`, `lib32-libxext`). In a Wayland
  session, the game uses them through XWayland. SDL uses Wayland itself
  only if the 32-bit Wayland libraries are version 1.20 or later
  (`lib32-wayland`, `lib32-libxkbcommon`; Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04 and
  Fedora 32 have older ones) and the compositor has the fifo-v1 protocol.
  On GNOME, the window then has borders only with the 32-bit libdecor
  (`lib32-libdecor`).

SteamOS has all of these. Its system is read-only, and the builds from
GitHub Actions need no package: they bring their own SDL3
(`libSDL3.so.0`, next to the executable).

### Portable build

The builds from GitHub Actions are portable builds (`--portable`; refer to
"Build options" in the main [README](../../README.md#build-options)). The
portable build starts on more systems than the build machine's:

- It is compiled and linked against the 32-bit glibc 2.31 of Debian 11, the
  glibc of the Steam Runtime 3 ("sniper"), not against the glibc of the
  build machine. An executable needs the glibc version that it was built
  against, or a later one.
- It brings SDL 3 (`libSDL3.so.0`), built from source against the same
  glibc. The executable looks for it in its own folder first (a `DT_RPATH`
  of `$ORIGIN`, which comes before `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), so that it uses this
  SDL even when Steam sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Few distributions have a
  32-bit SDL 3. This SDL loads X11, Wayland, libdecor, PipeWire, PulseAudio
  and ALSA when it starts, so it starts with whichever of them the system
  has. It is linked only to glibc. Its license is `SDL3-LICENSE.txt`.

At the first build, `tools/linux_sysroot.py` downloads the Debian packages
(about 25 MB) and the source of SDL. Each package comes from
`archive.debian.org` or `deb.debian.org`, or else from
`snapshot.debian.org`; the source of SDL comes from GitHub or from
`libsdl.org`. It checks each download against its SHA-256 sum. The system root is in
`build/linux/third_party/sysroot`. `tools/linux_sysroot.cmake` builds SDL
against it.

To make the portable build you need, in addition to the tools above,
CMake, `pkg-config` (`pkgconf`) and `wayland-scanner` (`wayland` on Arch
Linux, `libwayland-bin` on Debian and Ubuntu). You do not need the 32-bit
SDL3. You need the 32-bit glibc only for the tests.

To see the glibc version that a build needs, enter
`readelf -V build/linux/halo | grep -o 'GLIBC_[0-9.]*' | sort -uV | tail -1`.

## Build the game

1. Go to the root folder of the repository.
2. Enter `python configure.py`.
3. Enter `ninja linux`.

## Start the game

Enter `build/linux/halo`.

To play on a Steam Deck, unpack `halo-linux-release.zip` into a folder (in
Desktop Mode), and add `halo` to Steam as a non-Steam game ("Add a Game" in
the Games menu of Steam). The game then starts in Game Mode as well. Refer
to "Steam Deck".

The game data is the folder that contains `maps/`, from an Xbox disc image
of any version of the game. The game looks for this folder in this
sequence:

1. `paths.data` in `config.toml`.
2. The current folder.
3. The folder of the executable.
4. `assets/` in the current folder, and `assets/` in the repository that
   contains the executable.

If the game finds no data, it asks for an Xbox disc image (`.xiso` or
`.iso`). This occurs at the first start:

- Select "No" to stop the game.
- Select "Yes" to open a file picker. Select the disc image. The game copies
  `maps/` next to the executable and shows the progress.

The game writes the copy to `maps.partial`. When the copy is complete, the
game changes the name to `maps`. If the copy stops before it is complete,
the game asks for the disc image again at the next start.

### Steam Deck

Do the set-up in Desktop Mode: unpack the release, put `maps/` next to
`halo` (or start the game one time to copy it from a disc image), and add
`halo` to Steam. Then start the game from the library in Game Mode.

- Screen: the game fills the screen without borders (`display.mode` empty,
  thus borderless). The 3D view and the HUD have the shape of the screen
  (16:10) and are drawn at its resolution; the menus are at the center.
- Controls: Steam Input gives the game a virtual controller, which the game
  operates as the controller of the Xbox. With the template that Steam selects
  ("Gamepad With Joystick Trackpad"), the buttons, sticks and triggers have
  the functions of the same controls on an Xbox controller, the right
  trackpad operates as the right stick, and the back buttons (L4, L5, R4,
  R5) do nothing until you assign them in the controller settings of the
  game in Steam. With a template that makes a trackpad a mouse, the mouse
  aims in the game and moves the pointer in the menus.
- Text: names of profiles and gametypes use the keyboard of the game, which
  the controller operates. The text fields of the menus (the name and the
  password in Server Setup, and the password of a game in the server
  browser) open the keyboard of Steam. Type the text, then select Enter on
  that keyboard.
- Frame rate: the game shows one frame for each refresh of the display. It
  follows the refresh rate and the frame limit of Quick Access >
  Performance (40 to 60 Hz on the LCD model, up to 90 Hz on the OLED model).
  The world is calculated at 30 Hz at all rates. Keep `display.vsync =
  true`. Refer to "Frame rate".
- Sleep: the clocks of the game do not count the time that the Deck sleeps,
  so the game continues from where it stopped. A network game does not
  wait: the host drops a machine that it has not heard from for 15 seconds,
  and while a Deck that hosts sleeps, the other players have no host.

## Files and folders

| Xbox drive | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| `d:\` | The data root: the folder that contains `maps/`. |
| `z:\` | `z/` in the save root. This folder contains the cache (approximately 800 MB of map data) and the saved games. |
| `u:\` | `u/` in the save root. This folder contains the user data. |

The save root is `paths.saves` in `config.toml`. If that setting is empty,
the save root is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/halo-linux` (usually
`~/.local/share/halo-linux`).

The game makes the folders when it needs them. Names of files and folders
are not case-sensitive, as on the Xbox.

These files are in the data root:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `debug.txt` | The log of the game. At start-up, the game shows the data root in the terminal. A crash writes its report (the faulting address and the calls that led to it) here as well; the `reference address` line at the top of each session places those addresses in the build. |
| `init.txt` | Console commands that the game does at start-up. For example, `map_name levels\a10\a10` starts the first campaign level. |
| `tags/` | Sound tag files that replace the sounds of the maps (`audio.loose_sounds`). |

The settings are in `config.toml` next to the executable. Refer to
"Settings". Internet play's MQTT brokers are in `brokers.txt` next to it
(`network.brokers_file`).

If the game stops because of a fatal signal, it writes the address and a
backtrace to the standard error. To find the function at the address, enter
`addr2line -e build/linux/halo <address>`.

## Controls

The keyboard and the mouse are a control scheme of their own for the player
of controller 1: each action has up to two keys or mouse buttons, which
Settings > Controls Setup (or `[controls]` in `config.toml`) changes. The
game adds the input of the first gamepad to controller 1. The other
gamepads operate controllers 2 to 4. With two or more players on this
computer (co-op, or split screen in a network game) and only one gamepad,
that gamepad is controller 2 (player 2) and the keyboard and mouse stay
controller 1. The gamepad changes controller only when none of its buttons
is held. The profile's button layout (Settings > Gamepads) is the
gamepads' only.

| Action | Keys and buttons (default) |
| --- | --- |
| move | W, A, S, D |
| aim | mouse (direct aim) |
| fire | left mouse button |
| throw a grenade | right mouse button, G |
| jump (and skip a cutscene) | space |
| crouch | left ctrl, C |
| melee | F, mouse button 4 |
| reload | R |
| action (pick up, hold to swap weapons, enter or leave a vehicle; never reloads) | E |
| change the weapon | mouse wheel, 1 |
| change the grenade | X |
| flashlight | Q |
| zoom | Z, middle mouse button |
| show the scores (hold) | tab |
| pause menu | escape |
| screenshot | F10 |
| talk in voice chat (hold) | V |

Always: \` opens the developer console, F12 releases or captures the mouse,
F11 changes between fullscreen and window. Screenshot (default F10,
rebindable under Controls Setup > Actions, below Pause Menu; not on Android) saves a PNG of the completed
frame to `screenshots/` beside `maps/`, named `YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.png` in
local time, and prints the filename in the console. Captures in the same
second get a numeric suffix so previous screenshots are preserved.

One movement of the mouse wheel changes the weapon one time. A second
movement after a short pause changes it again.

In the menus, the mouse moves a pointer:

- The item below the pointer gets the focus.
- A left click selects the item. On a setting with values, a click on the
  left or right half changes the value. On a button in the key of a screen
  (for example "B = Back"), a click pushes that button.
- On the on-screen keyboard (a profile's name), a left click presses the
  key below the pointer, or pushes the "B =BACK" or "A =ENTER" legend.
- A right click goes back.
- The mouse wheel moves through the items.

The keyboard also operates the menus, with keys of its own: the arrow keys
(and W, A, S, D) move, space or enter selects, escape or backspace goes
back (escape resumes the game from the pause menu), delete deletes. When the game continues, the mouse aims again. A mouse button that you hold from the menu does not fire until
you push it again.

## Menus

The menus are the PC version's (Halo Custom Edition's): its main menu and
every screen it leads to (campaign, profiles, multiplayer with its server
browser, direct IP and server setup, the gametype editor, and the profile's
settings: controls, gamepads, mouse, audio, video, network and colour),
laid out as it has them. Their pictures are the high-res redraws; the few
that are not yet (3D renders, screenshots) are drawn from the Xbox's own
menus where it has the same, else a placeholder, listed in
`port/assets/menus/NON_HANDDRAWN.md`.

The campaign is wired: Campaign, on player 1's profile (the one last used),
continues its saved game, starts a level it has reached at a difficulty (New
Game), or loads or deletes any profile's saved game (Load Game). Many of the
other functions behind the screens are not wired to this game yet
(`port/assets/menus/UNWIRED.md`): the lists they fill (profiles, maps,
servers, key bindings) are empty, and the settings they change do not
change. The screens open, close and move between each other as the PC
version's. `display.menus = "xbox"` gives the Xbox's menus, which start every
kind of game.

Multiplayer > CO-OP CAMPAIGN is the Xbox's cooperative play, which the PC
version does not have: two players on this computer play the campaign in
split screen. Player 1 is the player who chose it, on the current profile.
Player 2 then chooses a profile with their own controller (a gamepad), and
New Game's levels are those either profile has reached. Either player's
controller chooses the level and the difficulty. A co-op game does
not continue a saved game of one player.

Network games have split screen too: up to 4 players on each computer. In
the game lobby, another controller presses START to join, and the new
player's profile is chosen on the ADD PLAYER screen that opens (with any
controller). With one gamepad, choose the lobby's ADD PLAYER button first:
until then that gamepad shares controller 1 with the keyboard. Two players on one profile get different names from the host. A
player's B in the lobby leaves the game alone, and the last player of the
computer leaves it for all of them. In the game, each player's pause menu
opens on their part of the screen, and its LEAVE GAME is theirs: their part
of the screen stays until the game ends. A game under way shows its own
screen before JOIN GAME: players join there the same way, START or ADD
PLAYER then START, and JOIN GAME brings them all into the game.

In a multiplayer game, the pause menu (escape) has SETTINGS, which opens
the profile's settings while the game goes on, and for the host END GAME.
END GAME ends the game as its time limit does: the players stay, and after
the carnage report the host picks the next map and gametype (PICK GAME).
LEAVE GAME of the host still ends the game for everyone. The buttons go into
the map's own pause menu, before LEAVE GAME, so the buttons of a custom map
stay. The Xbox's pause box is drawn taller to hold them (a redraw,
`port/assets/menus/port_svg/pause`); a custom map's box keeps its size, and
what is below its list moves down. The few pictures of the settings that
come from the main menu's map are not drawn there.

In a single-player campaign, the pause menu has SETTINGS too, before REVERT
TO SAVED, in the same box: a list with room for it centres its rows, and
one without keeps its size, its rows closer. It opens the same settings,
while the game stays paused, with only Controls, Gamepads, Mouse, Audio and
Video Setup; Gamepads' OK saves the profile at once.

The menus are XML files in `port/assets/menus` (`tools/ce_menus.py` writes
them from the PC version's tags), which the game contains. To change them,
put files in a `menus` folder next to `config.toml`: a file with the same
path replaces one of the game's, and another `.xml` file is added.
`port/assets/menus/README.md` describes the files. If a file has a problem,
the game uses the Xbox's menus and the log names the file, the line and the
problem.

## Settings

The settings are in `config.toml` next to the executable
(`build/linux/config.toml`). At the first start, the game writes the file
with the default values and a comment for each setting. To get the default
values again, delete the file.

The game reads the file at start-up. If a key is not correct, or a value
has the wrong type, the game writes the line to the log and uses the default
value. The Settings menu (Video, Mouse, Audio, Network and Controls Setup)
changes the useful settings, writes them into the file (only their lines
change) and applies them at once, but `audio.enabled`, and `display.menus`
from the next main menu.

Each setting has an environment variable. The environment variable changes
the setting for one start of the game. It has priority over the file.

| Setting | Default | Environment variable | Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `display.mode` | `""` | `HALO_DISPLAY_MODE` | `"fullscreen"`: the display, taken at the mode of `display.resolution` (the nearest the display has), or at its desktop mode. `"borderless"`: a window over the whole desktop, whose mode does not change. `"windowed"`: a window of `display.window_size`. Empty: `display.fullscreen` decides (`true`: borderless). F11 changes between the window and the fullscreen mode. Video Setup sets it. |
| `display.fullscreen` | `true` | `HALO_FULLSCREEN` | `true`: borderless, as `display.mode = "borderless"`. `false`: a window, as `display.mode = "windowed"`. Used when `display.mode` is empty. |
| `display.resolution` | `"native"` | `HALO_RESOLUTION` | What fullscreen and borderless draw at: `"native"`, the display's own resolution, or `"<width>x<height>"`, such as `"1920x1080"`, 640x480 or more. Fullscreen sets the display to it. Borderless draws at it and scales the picture to the display, where the display has room for it. The picture has 480 lines of the game and the width of the resolution's shape. A window draws at its own size instead. Video Setup's Resolution sets it, from the display's modes; it shows with Fullscreen and Borderless. |
| `display.resolution_scaling` | `"native"` | `HALO_RESOLUTION_SCALING` | `"native"`: the game draws at the resolution of the window, or of the display (or `display.resolution`) fullscreen. `"original"`: the game draws the 640x480 picture of the Xbox and scales it up to the window or the display, whatever `display.mode` is. Video Setup sets it. |
| `display.window_size` | `""` | `HALO_WINDOW_SIZE` | The size of the window, as `"<width>x<height>"`, such as `"1920x1080"`, 640x480 or more. You can change the size of the window; the game's picture takes its shape. Empty: `display.window_scale` decides. Video Setup's Window Size sets it, from sizes of each shape (4:3, 16:10, 16:9 and 21:9) that fit the desktop; it shows with Windowed. |
| `display.window_scale` | `2` | `HALO_WINDOW_SCALE` | Used when `display.window_size` is empty: the size of the window, as a multiple of 640x480. |
| `display.vsync` | `true` | `HALO_NO_VSYNC=1` sets `false` | `true`: each frame waits for the display. |
| `display.max_fps` | `0` | `HALO_MAX_FPS` | With vsync off, the most frames each second. `0`: twice the display's refresh rate. `-1`: no limit, which can hang some Intel graphics (Raptor Lake), resetting the desktop's graphics too. |
| `display.anti_aliasing` | `"off"` | `HALO_ANTI_ALIASING` | The smoothing of jagged edges, which the Xbox did not have. `"off"`: none, as on the Xbox. `"fxaa"` or `"smaa"`: a pass over the 3D view after the game draws it. The HUD and the menus stay sharp. SMAA is the sharper and costs more. `"ssaa2x"`: the game draws at two times the resolution in each direction (at most the GPU's largest texture), and the picture is scaled down. The GPU does four times the work. Not with `display.resolution_scaling = "original"`. `"msaa2x"`, `"msaa4x"` or `"msaa8x"`: each pixel of the 3D view has that many samples (at most the GPU's). On Android, `"smaa"` gives FXAA and `"ssaa2x"` none. A change applies from the next frame. Refer to "Anti-aliasing" in "What operates". |
| `debug.gpu_flush_draws` | `-1` | `HALO_GPU_FLUSH_DRAWS` | Flush the GPU's pipeline every this many draws. `-1`: every 3 on Intel graphics with Mesa's driver, which can otherwise hang in the game's long runs of small draws and reset the desktop's graphics too. `0`: never. |
| `display.interpolation` | `true` | `HALO_INTERPOLATION` | `true`: one frame for each refresh of the display. `false`: 30 frames each second, as on the Xbox. Refer to "Frame rate". |
| `display.direct_camera` | `true` | `HALO_DIRECT_CAMERA` | `true`: in first person, on foot, the view points where the player aims in each frame, not where the last tick left it. Refer to "Frame rate". |
| `display.fov` | `0.0` | `HALO_FOV` | The first-person view's field of view on foot, in degrees across at 16:9, from 20 to 150. `0`: the stock view. Refer to "Field of view". |
| `display.viewmodel_fov` | `0.0` | `HALO_VIEWMODEL_FOV` | The first-person weapon's and hands' field of view, in degrees across at 16:9, from 20 to 150. `0`: the weapon's stock view, also when `display.fov` widens the world. Refer to "Field of view". |
| `display.viewmodel_visible` | `true` | `HALO_VIEWMODEL_VISIBLE` | `true`: the first-person weapon, hands and what is attached to them are drawn. `false`: they are not; firing, animation, sound and lights go on, and other players' models are drawn. |
| `display.high_res_hud` | `true` | `HALO_HIGH_RES_HUD` | `true`: the HUD (meters, counters, panels and their outlines, the motion sensor, reticles, waypoints, scopes) is drawn from the high-res assets in `port/assets/hud`, 8x the size of the maps' bitmaps. The bitmaps with English text keep the maps' own. `false`: the maps' own bitmaps. |
| `display.high_res_text` | `true` | `HALO_HIGH_RES_TEXT` | `true`: the menus' and HUD's text is drawn with the fonts in `port/assets/fonts` (Overpass, in place of the maps' Interstate) at the resolution the game draws at, laid out as before; the menus' titles are drawn from the high-res pictures in `port/assets/titles`, and the controller button icons from those in `port/assets/buttons`. `false`: the maps' bitmap fonts, titles and button icons. |
| `display.shadow_resolution` | `128` | `HALO_SHADOW_RESOLUTION` | The size of the maps that the shadows of the objects are drawn in, in pixels each way: `128`, `256`, `512` or `1024` (other values go down to one of these). The game draws the shadow of each object into a map of 128x128 pixels, blurs it and projects it onto the ground. On a large screen, the edges of these shadows show steps that move when the object moves. A larger map makes the edges smooth; the blur is made wider to match, so the shadows are as soft as on the Xbox. Each doubling adds two passes of the blur. `128`: as on the Xbox. |
| `display.menus` | `"pc"` | `HALO_MENUS` | `"pc"`: the PC version's menus, from the files in `port/assets/menus` and a `menus` folder next to `config.toml`. Refer to "Menus". `"xbox"`: the Xbox's menus. |
| `display.player_names` | `"all"` | `HALO_PLAYER_NAMES` | In multiplayer, whose names are drawn above their heads: `"all"`, `"allies"`, `"enemies"` or `"none"`. An ally's name is drawn above the triangle the game shows over teammates. An enemy's name shows only within the motion sensor's reach, while the enemy is in sight and not camouflaged, so it never shows where an enemy hides. The gametype's motion tracker setting also applies: no names if it shows no players, only allies' if it shows only friends. |
| `display.player_name_scale` | `1.0` | `HALO_PLAYER_NAME_SCALE` | How large the players' names are drawn: `1.0` is three quarters of the size of the HUD's text, from `0.25` to `4`. With high-res text, larger names are rasterized at their size, so they stay sharp. |
| `display.scoreboard_team_layout` | `"teams"` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_TEAM_LAYOUT` | How the multiplayer scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) lists a team game's players. `"teams"`: a column for each team, red on the left and blue on the right. `"score"`: all the players in order of score. With more players than fit, the mouse wheel and Page Up / Page Down scroll the scoreboard. |
| `display.scoreboard_background` | `true` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_BACKGROUND` | `true`: the multiplayer scoreboard (hold BACK, or tab) has a panel behind its text, for clearer text. |
| `display.scoreboard_background_color` | `"16, 16, 16, 150"` | `HALO_SCOREBOARD_BACKGROUND_COLOR` | The colour of the scoreboard's panel: `"red, green, blue, alpha"`, each from `0` to `255`. Alpha `0` is see-through, `255` is solid. |
| `display.per_pixel_lighting` | `false` | `HALO_PER_PIXEL_LIGHTING` | `false`: the models (characters, weapons, vehicles, scenery) are lit at each vertex and the light is blended between them, as on the Xbox. The light across a curved surface then shows facets, and a point light that passes close lights only the vertices it reaches. `true`: the models are lit at each pixel by the same lights (the ambient light, two distant lights and two point lights), which changes their look. |
| `audio.enabled` | `true` | `HALO_NO_AUDIO=1` sets `false` | `false`: no audio device. The sound continues without output. |
| `audio.volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_VOLUME` | The master volume. |
| `audio.music_volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_MUSIC_VOLUME` | The music's volume, of the master volume. |
| `audio.effects_volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_EFFECTS_VOLUME` | The volume of the other sounds (effects and speech), of the master volume. |
| `audio.reverb` | `true` | `HALO_REVERB` | `true`: the sounds of the world reverberate as the place the player is in does: the sound environments of the maps (a corridor, a cave, a large hall, outdoors) set the reverberation, as the I3DL2 reverb of the Xbox did. A sound behind a wall or a door is muffled in it too. `false`: no reverberation (sounds behind a wall are still muffled). |
| `audio.voice_chat` | `"push_to_talk"` | `HALO_VOICE_CHAT` | How you talk in voice chat: `"push_to_talk"` (while `controls.push_to_talk` is held; the microphone opens when you first press it), `"open_mic"` (when the microphone hears speech), or `"off"`. You hear the other players in every case. Refer to "Voice chat". |
| `audio.voice_volume` | `1.0` | `HALO_VOICE_VOLUME` | The volume of the voices of the other players, `0` to `2`. |
| `audio.output_device`, `audio.input_device` | `"default"` | `HALO_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE`, `HALO_AUDIO_INPUT_DEVICE` | The speakers and the microphone, by the name that Settings > Audio shows, or `"default"` for the device of the system. If the device is not found, the game uses the device of the system. Not on Android. |
| `audio.loose_sounds` | `false` | `HALO_LOOSE_SOUNDS` | For those who make sounds. `true`: each sound of a map that has a sound tag file of its name in `tags/` in the data root (for example `tags/sound/sfx/weapons/assault rifle/fire.sound`) plays from that file. The files are Halo PC tag files, as the Halo Editing Kit and Invader write them. At the console, `loose_sounds_reload` reads the files again, and `loose_sounds false` plays the sounds of the map again. When a file changes, all sounds stop. |
| `input.mouse_sensitivity` | `1.0` | `HALO_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY` | The multiplier for the mouse aim. |
| `input.mouse_vertical_sensitivity` | `0.0` | `HALO_MOUSE_VERTICAL_SENSITIVITY` | The multiplier for the vertical mouse aim. `0`: the same as `input.mouse_sensitivity`. |

With Mesa drivers, the game sends its GL calls through the GL thread of
Mesa. To stop this, set the environment variable `mesa_glthread=false`.

## Updates

The builds from GitHub Actions (refer to the main [README](../../README.md#download))
can update themselves. At start-up, the game asks GitHub for the latest
release. The game does not wait for the answer. If the latest release is not
newer, the game does nothing.

If the latest release is newer, the game asks: "Do you want to update?"

- Select "Yes" to update. The game downloads the release for this platform,
  replaces its files and starts the new version. The old files get the
  extension `.old`. The new version deletes them.
- Select "No" to continue. The game asks again at the next start.
- Select "Do not ask again", then "Yes", to stop the questions. The game
  writes `auto = false` in the `[update]` section of `config.toml`. To get
  the questions again, set `auto = true`.

The game downloads through HTTPS. It examines the certificate of the server
against the certificate authorities of the system: on Linux, the bundle of
the distribution (`src/posix_update.c`, with Mbed TLS); on Windows, the
certificate store of Windows (WinHTTP). The folder of the executable must
let the game write to it.

Builds that you make yourself have no build number. They do not look for
updates.

## Frame rate

The game calculates its world at 30 Hz, as on the Xbox. On the Xbox, the
game showed one frame for each calculation (tick). This port shows one frame
for each refresh of the display, for example at 60, 120 or 240 Hz.

Each frame shows the world between the last two ticks
(`game/render_interpolation.c`):

- After each tick, the game keeps the camera, the position of each part of
  each object, and the first-person weapon.
- Each frame mixes the last two ticks. The mix agrees with the time since
  the last tick.
- Rotations use quaternions. Positions and scales are linear.
- A teleport, a respawn or a cut of the camera does not mix. It jumps.
- After a long frame (several ticks in one frame), the camera mixes the
  last tick only, as the objects do.
- In cinematics, a camera that moves with an object (the lifepod in a30,
  a Pelican) moves with the object as it is drawn.

Thus the frames are one tick (33 ms) after the calculation. The calculation
does not change.

The direction of the view is an exception. The game reads the mouse and the
sticks in each frame. In first person, on foot, each frame points the view
where the player aims at that time (`display.direct_camera`). Thus the view
turns in the frame that the mouse moves. In a vehicle and in cinematics, the
view mixes as the other things do. On Android, the view mixes as before.

To get 30 frames each second, set `display.interpolation = false`.

To see the frame rate:

1. Push \` to open the developer console.
2. Enter `display_framerate true`.

In the game of another host, the console runs only the commands that change
nothing of the game (such as `display_framerate`), and the game puts back
cheats, the game speed and the settings of the drawing that show more of
the world (such as `rasterizer_wireframe`). Refer to `NETCODE.md`.

The frame rate shows at the bottom right of the screen. It is the mean over
half a second.

## Field of view

Video Setup's FOV AND VIEWMODELS screen sets the field of view of the
first-person view (`display.fov`) and of the weapon and hands
(`display.viewmodel_fov`), from 80 to 150 degrees in steps of 5, and can
hide the weapon (`display.viewmodel_visible`). DEFAULT, the setting's `0`,
keeps the stock view. `config.toml` takes any angle from 20 to 150.

- An angle is across the screen at 16:9. Another shape keeps the same
  angle up and down, as the stock view does.
- The field of view applies on foot in first person only. Vehicles, death,
  cinematics and scripted cameras keep their own view.
- A scope's zoom levels keep their stock view: the extra width fades out as
  the zoom comes in. A view narrower than the stock one narrows the zoom
  too.
- The reticles scale with the view, so that they stay on the aim. The
  scopes' pictures keep their place.
- By default the weapon keeps its stock view when the world is wider:
  arms and a gun right against the camera stretch at a wide angle.

Only this machine's view changes. Nothing the machines send each other
changes, so players with different settings play together.

## System link

The Xbox game lets 16 players on 4 machines play a system link game. This
port lets up to 128 players on up to 128 machines play. Each machine can
have up to 4 players (split screen).

- `include/halo_port_limits.h` sets the limits.
- `include/halo_port_capacity.h` sets the memory for the limits. The game
  state is 16 MB at `0x81A00000` (3.3 MB on the Xbox). The pools of objects,
  effects, particles, contrails, lights and sounds are also larger.

Obey these rules:

- All the machines in a game must use a build with the same limits.
- The port uses protocol version 2. It does not see the Xbox game or older
  builds of the port. They do not see the port.

These are the differences from the Xbox:

- The host waits up to 60 seconds (15 seconds on the Xbox) for the other
  machines to load the map.
- If a machine does not read the messages of the host for two seconds, the
  host removes it from the game.
- The saved games contain all the game state. Thus a saved game is 16 MB.
  Saved games from older builds of the port do not operate.
- In campaign and in games of up to 16 players, the game removes garbage
  (bodies, dropped weapons) as on the Xbox. In larger games, it keeps more
  garbage, in proportion to the players.
- The lobby shows the local machine and the first three remote machines.
  The other machines are also in the game.
- In free-for-all games, each player is a team.

Linux, Windows and Android machines can play in the same game. Each machine
simulates the players from the same inputs, and the host does not correct
all of the game. Thus each machine must calculate the same floating-point
results, and all the ports:

- Compile without fused multiply-add (`-ffp-contract=off`).
- Use the math functions of musl (`port/include/halo_math.h`,
  `port/third_party/musl-math`), not the math functions of the system.

### Play on one computer

More than one copy of the game can play on one computer. Each copy must
have a different loopback address. A copy with an address gets no
broadcasts. Thus each copy must send its broadcasts to the other copies.

For a host and two clients, enter these commands in three terminals:

```sh
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.200 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.201,127.0.0.202 build/linux/halo
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.201 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.200 build/linux/halo
HALO_NET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.202 HALO_NET_BROADCAST=127.0.0.200 build/linux/halo
```

Do not give 127.0.0.1 to a copy. Each copy gets to its own address through
127.0.0.1. Linux and Windows send all of 127.0.0.0/8 to the loopback
interface.

### Test with many machines

`tools/system_link_bots.py` adds simple machines to a game. Each machine has
one player. The machines obey the system link protocol, but they do not
calculate the game or move their players.

1. Start a game on the host.
2. Enter `python tools/system_link_bots.py --host 127.0.0.200 --machines 127 --start`.

Each machine uses its own loopback address, from 127.0.0.2. The option
`--start` starts the game when all the machines are in the lobby. If the
host has no `network.address`, do not give `--host`.

## Internet play

Machines with an invite link can play system link on the internet. This
project has no server.

When a copy of the game starts to host a system link game, it makes an
invite link: `halo://join/<64 hexadecimal digits>`. The game writes the link
to the standard error and puts it on the clipboard. The links of older
versions of the game (44 digits) do not operate. The game writes a message
when it gets one.

To join a game, do one of these steps:

- Open the link. The game is the handler of `halo://` links. If the game
  already operates, the new copy gives the link to it and stops. A key in a
  file that only the user can read (`halo-ce-universal.key` in
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, else `~/.halo-ce-universal.key`; on Windows in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) encrypts the link, so the programs of other users cannot
  read it.
- Copy the link (or the 64 digits) and go to the game.
- Enter `halo <link>`.
- Accept a Discord invite. Refer to "Discord".

When the machines connect, the game of the host shows in Multiplayer,
System Link. Join the game as on a local network. System link on a local
network does not need an invite.

### Voice chat

Network games have voice chat, on the local network and on the internet.
Hold V (`controls.push_to_talk`, Settings > Controls Setup) to talk, or set
VOICE CHAT in Settings > Audio to OPEN MIC. VOICE VOLUME sets the volume of
the other players. On Android, set VOICE CHAT to OPEN MIC to talk: the game
then asks for the microphone.

OUTPUT DEVICE and INPUT DEVICE in Settings > Audio select the speakers and
the microphone (SYSTEM DEFAULT, the default, follows the system). The list
has the devices that the computer had when the game started.

The host sets voice chat for all players in Server Setup > Teamplay Options
(`network.voice_*` in `config.toml`):

- In the lobby, before and after a game, all players hear all players
  (LOBBY VOICE CHAT).
- During a game (VOICE CHAT): OFF; TEAM NEAR; ANYONE NEAR; TEAM; or TEAM,
  ENEMIES NEAR (the default). Near is VOICE NEAR DISTANCE (45 metres is the
  default), and both players must be alive. A player who is near sounds
  quieter when further, and from their direction. In a game without teams
  all players are enemies; in co-op, all are teammates.
- The quality (VOICE QUALITY), 8 to 64 kilobits per second (24 is the
  default), in the lobby and in the game.

In co-op, Server Setup has no Teamplay Options: the same settings are in
Server Setup > Voice and Voting.

A speaker shows next to the name of a player who talks: in the lobby, on
the scoreboard, in a list at the left of the screen during a game, and
beside the name above their head (when names are shown there:
`display.player_names`). To mute a player, open the scoreboard,
right-click, click the player, and click Mute voice. You no longer hear
them, and nobody else is told.

The host sends each voice on to the players who can hear it. The host
accepts a voice only from the machine of the player (with a key that it
gives each machine on its connection), only at the quality it set, at most
50 frames each second from a machine, and from at most 8 players at a time.
The voices are compressed with Opus (`port/third_party/opus`).

### Server browser

Server Setup in Create Game > Internet has a LISTING row:

- PUBLIC (the default): the game also shows in Join Game > Server Browser
  on every machine. Anyone can see and join the game.
- PRIVATE: only players with the invite link can join.

Each new game starts as PUBLIC (`network.host_public = false` makes new
games start as PRIVATE). An online co-op game starts as PRIVATE, and keeps
the last choice of its LISTING (`network.coop_public`). A LAN game is never listed. `network.public_lobby = false` turns the server browser off.

A PUBLIC game can also have a PASSWORD (a row of Server Setup, below
LISTING). The Server Browser shows a lock at the left of a game with a
password. A player who selects that game must type the password, and JOIN
GAME joins only with the correct password. The invite link of the game joins
it without the password. The host keeps the password only while the game
runs.

In the Server Browser, select a game to join it. The game joins the invite
of the game, as for a link. When it reaches the host, it opens the lobby.
If it cannot reach the host in 30 seconds, it marks the game FAILED. A game
that is full or starting shows CLOSED. REFRESH asks the hosts for their
listings again.

How it operates (`src/p2p_lobby.c`):

- The host of a public game publishes a listing: the invite, and the name,
  map, gametype and player counts of the game. The listing goes to the
  same MQTT brokers as the invites (`network.brokers_file`), retained,
  to a topic of the host (`hceu/3/lobby/s/<hash of its key>`).
- The key of the host signs the listing (Ed25519). The key is the key of the
  invite, so no other machine can list the invite of the host, change its
  listing, or list a game with false details.
- The host publishes the listing again every 30 seconds, when the game
  changes, and when a browser asks. If the topic of the host is empty or
  holds another listing, the host publishes again in 5 seconds or less. Thus
  a broker that deletes the listing does not remove the game.
- When the host stops (it stops hosting, the game becomes private, or the
  game quits), it publishes a closed listing, and then empties its topic.
  If the host loses its connection, the broker empties its topic (the will
  of the connection). A browser removes a game that it does not hear for 90
  seconds.
- When a public game becomes private, the host makes a new invite. Thus a
  player who saw the listing cannot join with the old invite.
- The listing of a game with a password does not hold the invite in clear
  text. The secret part of the invite (its token) is encrypted with a key
  from the password (Argon2id, salted with the key of the host, then
  XChaCha20-Poly1305). The browser makes the key from the password that the
  player types, and opens the invite only if the password is correct. When
  the host sets or changes the password, it makes a new invite. A player who
  has the listing can try passwords on their own machine without the host,
  so use a long password.

A public game does not publish the address of the host. But any machine
with the invite can ask the host to connect, and the host then sends its
addresses. Thus anyone can learn the address of the host of a public game,
as for any public server.

The brokers are in `brokers.txt` next to the executable (from
`port/assets/network/brokers.txt`; on Android, the app writes it next to
`config.toml` at each start), one `host:port` on each line. The game uses
all of them at once (up to 4), so one that works is enough. An update
replaces `brokers.txt`: to use brokers of your own, put them in another
file and name it in `network.brokers_file`. All the players must use the
same broker to see each other's games. The game uses
MQTT 5 if the broker has it, else MQTT 3.1.1. A broker that does not keep
retained messages, or does not let clients subscribe with wildcards, carries
only invites, not listings.

### Security

Only machines with the invite can find the game:

- Each copy of the game makes an Ed25519 key pair when it starts, and from
  it an X25519 key pair (Monocypher, `port/third_party/monocypher`). Its
  identifier is from the hash of its X25519 public key. The Ed25519 key
  signs the listing of a public game.
- The link contains a 16-byte hash of the public key of the host and a
  random 16-byte token. The identifier of the host is from the first 6
  bytes of the hash.
- The machines exchange their public keys and addresses through public MQTT
  brokers (`network.brokers_file`). The topics are HMACs of the token.
  A key from the token encrypts and authenticates the messages
  (`src/p2p_signal.c`, `src/p2p_crypto.c`). The host authenticates its answer
  with a key that only it and the player can calculate. Its public key must
  agree with the hash in the link. The hash is long, so no other machine can
  find a key with the same hash.
- Then the player shows in the same way that it has the private key of its
  public key. Only then does the host make a session for the player. Thus
  other machines with the invite cannot make sessions in the name of a
  player (such a session would keep the player out).
- Each two machines get the keys of their packets from their key pairs and
  a random number from each. The keys do not go through the brokers. Thus
  other machines with the invite cannot read or change the packets.
- Each packet is encrypted and authenticated, with a different key in each
  direction. A machine ignores a packet that it already received.
- A machine can send only to the ports of the game on the other machine.
- The host makes one session from each request of a player. If a person
  sends a copy of an old request again, the host ignores it. A player that
  must ask again sends a new request.
- The host tries to reach at most 8 new players at the same time. The
  other players ask again.
- The host answers a request that is not proven at most one time each
  second through each broker. It answers at most 20 of these requests each
  second, after a first 32. Each answer goes only through the broker that
  brought the request. Thus a flood of requests does not use much of the
  bandwidth of the host.
- The host does the key work of at most 20 requests each second from keys
  that it does not know, after a first 32. It keeps the key work of the
  last 256 keys. Thus the proof of a player does not need more key work. A
  flood of requests can make players join more slowly. A player asks again
  for 90 seconds.
- The host refuses the predicted movement of a player whose game runs
  faster than time (a speed hack). If the messages on the player's
  connection were also ahead for ten seconds, the host drops and bans the
  player: each player sees who in red on the console, and the host adds a
  line to `cheaters.txt` and `bans.txt` (beside `debug.txt`) with the
  address and hardware id of the player, and the Discord name and id that
  the game of the player told it, marked `(self-reported)` (a player can
  change these). The host refuses a machine whose address or hardware id is
  in `bans.txt`. If only the player's datagrams were ahead, the host does
  not drop the player, because another machine can send datagrams with the
  player's address: it adds an `unverified` line to `cheaters.txt`.
- The host can ban a player with `ban <player name>` in the developer
  console (Tab completes the name). Remove a line from `bans.txt` to unban.
  Refer to `NETCODE.md`. `kick <player name>` drops the player the same
  way, but keeps nothing: no line in `bans.txt`, and the player can join
  again at once. In co-op, `bringto` brings every player to the host.
- Players can vote to kick a player. The host turns this on or off with
  VOTE KICK in Server Setup > Teamplay Options (`network.votekick`; in
  co-op, Server Setup > Voice and Voting). Hold the scoreboard key, right-click to
  show the pointer, and click the name of the player. Then click **Start
  a vote to kick**. Other players vote in the same way, and see the vote on
  the scoreboard. `votekick <player name>` in the developer console does
  the same. The host also gets **Kick** and **Ban** in this menu: these do
  the same as the `kick` and `ban` commands (click **Ban** two times). The
  host counts the votes, and these rules prevent abuse:
  - The vote passes when more than half of the players vote for it, and at
    least two players. The player of the vote is counted, but cannot vote.
    Thus, in a game of two equal teams, one team cannot kick a player of
    the other team without help.
  - The host counts one vote for each internet address (for internet
    play, the real address of the player, not the address of the tunnel).
    Two machines at one address, or with one hardware id, have one vote.
  - To start a vote, a player must have played for
    `network.votekick_minutes` (5) on this server. To vote, a player must
    have played for 2 minutes (or less, if that setting is less). The host
    counts the time. When a player joins again, the time starts again.
    Players who cannot vote yet are not counted.
  - The host only accepts a vote that comes on the connection of the
    player, not a datagram, which another machine can send with the
    address of the player.
  - One vote runs at a time, for 45 seconds, with 30 seconds before the
    next vote. If a vote fails, the player who started it cannot start a
    vote for 5 minutes, and nobody can start a vote against the same player
    for 10 minutes.
  - Nobody can vote to kick a player of the host.
  - A player kicked by a vote cannot join again for
    `network.votekick_ban_minutes` (30), by address and hardware id.
  - A player who leaves during a vote against them is kept out the same
    way, as if the vote passed. While the vote runs, the host refuses the
    player if they try to join again. Thus nobody can avoid a vote by
    leaving.
  So that every player can be named, the host trims the spaces around a
  name and removes characters that draw as nothing. A
  letter with a mark is typed as the plain letter (`ban jose` for "José").
  A name with nothing left to type becomes "Player", and a name that another
  player already has gets a number ("Player 2"). The game refuses a profile
  name that is blank, and a multiplayer game refuses a profile whose name was
  made blank before this check.
- An invite operates while the copy of the game that made it operates.

### Connection

Each machine gets its public address from public STUN servers. Then the two
machines send packets to each other until the packets get through (UDP hole
punching). There is no relay.

Some networks give a different port for each destination (for example some
mobile and company networks). Two machines behind such networks cannot
connect. To connect, forward `network.tunnel_port` on the router of one of
the machines.

The game can ask the router to forward the port (UPnP,
`src/posix_upnp.c`, with `port/third_party/miniupnpc`):

- The host asks its router when a player uses its invite.
- A player that joins asks its router when it does not reach the host in
  5 seconds.
- The forwarded port is one more address that the machine gives to the
  other machine.
- The forward has a duration of one hour. The game makes it longer while
  it operates. When the game stops normally, it removes the forward. It
  does not remove the forward after a crash, or if a request to the router
  is still under way 3 seconds after the game starts to stop. Some routers only make forwards without a duration.
- When the game finds the router, it removes the forwards to this machine
  that have the description "Halo internet play" and that no copy of the
  game uses now (forwards that a copy of the game did not remove).
- UPnP does not help behind a second NAT, for example the NAT of a mobile
  network provider. Then the router has a private address, and the game
  does not ask.

To stop all UPnP requests, set `network.allow_upnp` to `false`.

In the game, each machine has an address in 100.64.0.0/10:

- `src/xnet.c` gives the datagrams that the bound UDP sockets of the game
  send to such an address to `src/p2p.c`. Other datagrams (of sockets that
  are not bound yet, or that are connected to the address) and the TCP
  connections of the game go through local sockets on 127.0.0.1 (or
  `network.address`). The traffic from the other machines comes to the
  game from local sockets too.
- `src/p2p.c` sends that traffic through one UDP socket. UDP datagrams go
  as they are. TCP connections go as KCP streams (`port/third_party/kcp`).
- The broadcasts of the game go to all the machines. Thus the game of the
  host shows on the other machines.

### Discord

If the Discord desktop client operates, the game of the host shows in
Discord (through the application of `discord.application_id`). The activity
has a private party with the invite as its join secret. The host can send
the invite with the invite button of Discord. When a person accepts it, that
person joins the game. If the game does not operate, Discord starts it.
The game sends the activity only to a Discord client of the same user.

## Map checks

The game reads a map's tags straight into memory and uses them as its own
structures: every pointer, count, index and enum in them is the map's, and
the game writes values into tags as it runs. So before anything reads a
map's tags, the port checks every tag against a schema of its group
(`game/tag_schema_*.c`, read by `game/tag_validate.c`), and each structure
BSP as it loads:

- Every block and every piece of data must lie in the tags (or the BSP) and
  overlap no other. Otherwise the game refuses the map.
- A block with more elements than the game has room for is cut to the
  maximum. A tag reference that is not a tag of the right group becomes
  none. So do an index past its block and an enum past its values (or they
  become 0, where the game cannot take none). A string gets its terminator.
  Values that the game sets as it runs are reset.
- Checks that the schema cannot express run last: the BSPs' and the models'
  graphs, vertex and index buffers, and indices into other tags.

Each correction goes to `debug.txt`. The game's own maps need none.
`build/linux/map_validate [--strict] map.map...` runs the same checks on map
files without the game, and `tools/test_linux_port.py` runs it on the maps
in `assets/maps`. `map_validate --fuzz <runs> map.map` changes a few words
of the tags at random in each run. The checks must not crash or hang, and a
map that they let through must need no more corrections.

A map's scripts can call only the script functions that a map needs (the
allowlist in `hs/hs.c`). They cannot call the functions for files, the
saved state of the game, the console, debugging or cheats. A script that
calls one does not run. The developer console can call every function.

Halo Custom Edition maps get the same checks (those that need OpenSauce are
refused). Their own loader (`game/cache_file_formats.c`) reads them into
their tag cache at 0x40440000 and converts what Custom Edition lays out
differently, then the validator checks their tags and each of their BSPs as
it checks this build's maps, before the game converts their models, BSP
geometry and scripts. Put them with `bitmaps.map`, `sounds.map` and
`loc.map` in `custom_maps`, beside `maps`, or set `paths.custom_edition` to
a Custom Edition install; the map lists show them as CUSTOM SINGLEPLAYER and
CUSTOM MULTIPLAYER, played as campaign levels (alone, or as network co-op)
or as multiplayer maps by their scenario type, and `game.custom_edition =
false` refuses them. `map_validate` checks them too, with the resource maps
beside each map or in `--maps <folder>`. See
`docs/custom_edition_caches.md`.

Defensive checks stay in the game code too. An index into a tag block, the
tags or a tag's data that is out of range gets zeros (`tag_empty_data` in
`tag_files/tag_groups.c`), not other memory.

A map's name must be its file's: the cache file slots are found by the name
in the map's header, so a map file whose header names another map (a
renamed one) is refused, not copied again for ever. The `loading.tga` a map
pack may put in the maps folder is read only if it is an uncompressed 24-bit
picture of 320 by 240, the loading screen's texture.

A checkpoint (`savegame.bin`, in the profile's folder) and a core are
images of the game state's memory: with the data arrays' pointers to their
elements, the objects' memory pool's blocks and the references to them, and
the caches' procedures. Before one is taken, each of those is checked
against what the game made at startup (`game_state_image_accept` in
`saved games/game_state.c`): an image that does not match (a damaged or
crafted file) is refused, and the level starts over.

## What operates

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Game code | All 466 C files of the game. The changes are in "Game source changes". |
| Graphics | Direct3D 8 on OpenGL 4.5 core through SDL3 (`src/d3d8_gl.c`). The port translates the NV2A vertex shaders and register combiners to GLSL. It decodes all the Xbox texture formats. The vertex and index buffers come from a GL copy of the Xbox memory. |
| High-res HUD | The HUD is drawn from high-res assets: redraws at 8x the size of the maps' bitmaps (4x for the largest), in `port/assets/hud`. They cover the meters, counters, panels and their outlines, the motion sensor, reticles, waypoints and scopes, but no bitmap with English text. `tools/hud_assets.py` makes them from the SVG redraws (the weapons' reticles from those of the PC HUD sheet that match the Xbox's exactly, the sniper rifle's 2x and 10x set in Overpass), and the build embeds them in the executable. When the game uploads one of those bitmaps, `src/hud_hires.c` gives the high-res texture in its place, if the bitmap's pixels are those of the English maps: another language's maps keep their own. The game sizes and places the HUD from its tags as before. `display.high_res_hud = false` turns this off. |
| High-res text | The menus' and HUD's text is drawn with Overpass (`port/assets/fonts`, SIL Open Font License) in place of the maps' bitmap fonts, which are Interstate. `src/text_hires.c` rasterizes each glyph with stb_truetype (`port/third_party/stb`) at the resolution the game draws at, into an atlas that a placeholder bitmap of the game stands for. The game lays the text out from its font tags as before. The menus' titles (the screens' headers and the main menu's items) are pictures of text in the maps, so they are drawn as the high-res HUD is: `tools/title_assets.py` sets each one again in OpenCE, Roger White's public-domain Newtown respaced to match the maps' commercial title typeface (`tools/title_font.py`), at 4x the bitmap's size over its own plate or glow, each letter placed where the map's letter is, in `port/assets/titles`. The postgame carnage report's title is set over a hand-made SVG redraw of its panel (`port/assets/titles/svg`) instead. The A, B, X and Y button icons beside the menus' key labels and in their text ("Press A to Join") are drawn from hand-made SVG redraws at 8x the size of the maps' bitmaps (`port/assets/buttons`, made by `tools/button_assets.py`), in the same sizes and places. `display.high_res_text = false` turns it off. |
| Anti-aliasing | Off unless `display.anti_aliasing` is set (`src/d3d8_gl.c`, `src/xgpu_post.c`). FXAA (written in the port) and SMAA (`port/third_party/smaa`, MIT licensed, at its HIGH preset, compiled as GLSL) are passes over the 3D view of each window, after the lens flares and before the HUD and the menus (`render/render.c`). Their programs are built when the setting is chosen. Supersampling draws the render targets the size of the screen at two times the resolution in each direction, and the display blit scales them down. Multisampling draws the back buffer and its depth buffer into multisampled renderbuffers, and with them any target that is drawn together with one of them (a mirror's view, in the secondary target with the back buffer's depth buffer), so that the attachments of a framebuffer are all multisampled or none is. A target's pixels are resolved into its texture before something reads the texture (as a texture, or at the display blit). Visibility tests count samples, divided by the samples of a pixel. An alpha-tested surface (foliage, grates) covers the samples of a pixel in proportion to its alpha past the reference (`gl_SampleMask`, not on Android). |
| Sound | Xbox DirectSound on SDL3 audio (`src/dsound_sdl.c`): PCM and Xbox ADPCM, mixed at 48 kHz, with volume, pitch, mix bins, distance, stereo pan, occlusion and obstruction. There is no Doppler effect, no cones and no reverb. |
| Input | XInput on SDL3 (`src/xinput_sdl.c`): keyboard, mouse, gamepads with rumble, and the debug keyboard for the console. |
| Files | The Win32 file functions and the MSVC file functions on POSIX, with the translation of Xbox paths. |
| Threads | Threads, events, mutexes, critical sections, interlocked operations and alertable waits. |
| Memory | The port reserves the Xbox memory at `0x80000000`. Thus the game gets the fixed addresses that it expects. |
| Saved games | The Xbox `UDATA` layout, with SHA-1 signatures. |
| Networking | Winsock on BSD sockets. System link on a local network and on the internet. |
| Bink video | Not available. The game skips the movies. |

## How the port operates

### The compiler

`tools/linux_build.py` compiles the game with clang and these options, which
give the ABI of the MSVC compiler:

- `--target=i686-linux-gnu`: 32-bit x86.
- `-fms-extensions`: the MSVC extensions.
- `-fshort-wchar`: 16-bit `wchar_t`.
- `-malign-double`: 8-byte alignment of 64-bit members.
- `-fcommon`: tentative definitions, as in C89.

glibc gives only ISO C (`__STRICT_ANSI__`). Thus POSIX names, for example
`random`, do not conflict with the names of the game.

These files supply the MSVC functions that clang does not have:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `include/halo_linux_prefix.h` | The first header of each file: the architecture macros of the SDK, MSVC `__inline`, SEH keywords, `__declspec(selectany)`. |
| `include/` | Headers that add MSVC names to the C runtime headers. |
| `port/include/xdk` | The Xbox SDK declarations. The compiler reads this folder after all the other folders. |
| `tools/linux_msvc_semantics.py` | Makes a header that declares each struct tag at file scope, as MSVC does. It also makes the header inline functions weak, as the COMDAT functions of MSVC. `game/msvc_comdat.c` gives one external copy of each. |
| `include/halo_linux_winsock_names.h` | Gives new names to the Winsock functions of the SDK. Thus they do not link to the glibc functions with the same names. |
| `include/halo_linux_source_fixups.h` | Declares the port's functions that the game's sources call. |

`tools/linux_link_check.py` stops the link if a weak reference has no
definition. Without this check, the linker gives the reference the address
0.

### The platform layer (`src/`)

- The files `posix_*.c` use glibc. The compiler uses the ABI of the host
  for these files, because some glibc structures have a different layout
  with `-malign-double`.
- The other files include the SDK declarations through `platform.h`. Thus
  the compiler examines each definition against the SDK prototype.
- `src/halo_linker_common.c` gives weak storage for some globals of the
  January link, and for `fast_ftol_C` and `main_crash`.
- `main/d3d_intimacy.cpp` reads a private structure of the Xbox Direct3D.
  The Linux build does not use this file. `src/d3d8_gl.c` gives
  `d3d_find_flipcount`.
- The build returns small structures and unions in registers
  (`-freg-struct-return`), as on Win32.
- The GPU driver cannot open the kernel's `trace_marker`
  (`src/posix_trace_marker.c`). SteamOS keeps kernel tracing on for its GPU
  performance captures (`gpu-trace.service`), and its Mesa then writes a
  marker for each traced driver function: on the Steam Frame, some 480,000
  writes a second, which took the game from the headset's 72 Hz to about
  50 frames a second. The Steam Deck runs the same service, but its Mesa
  (25.3, 32-bit and 64-bit) has no markers to write: there the refusal
  changes nothing (measured: the same frame times and power either way).
  `HALO_GPU_TRACE_MARKERS=1` lets the driver write them, to capture with
  gpuvis.

### Game source changes

Five files of the game have changes for clang. These changes do not change
the MSVC objects: a comparison of all 612 C objects showed no difference in
code or data.

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `cseries/cseries.c` | The naked function `stristr` uses `[ebp+8]` and `[ebp+12]` for its parameters. |
| `bitmaps/bitmap_drawing.c` | `*((word *)p)++` is now `*(*(word **)&p)++`. |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_hardware_bitmaps.c` | `&(T *)x` is now `(T **)&x`. |
| `hs/hs.c` | Local prototypes that did not agree with `ai_script.h` are removed. |
| `units/vehicles.c` | The local prototype of `unit_update_animation` uses the type of `units.h`. |

`math/real_math.h` had a copy of `plane2d_from_points` that did not agree
with the function in `effects/decals.c`. clang used the copy, and parts of
levels were not visible. The copy now agrees with the function.

Other changes:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario/scenario.c` | The BSP connection tables have names, not MSVC offsets. |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_environment_fog.c` | A local pointer gets its value from the file-scope array with the same name. |
| `game/player_control.c` | The mouse aims the player on controller 1 directly. |
| `sound/game_sound.c` | The game calculates the obstruction of each sound one time for each tick, not for each frame. |
| `cseries/errors.c` | `debug.txt` stays open between lines. |
| `networking/`, `game/`, `interface/`, `bungie_net/network/` and the pools of objects, effects and sounds | The system link limits and the memory for them. |
| `game/`, `objects/`, `units/`, `networking/` | The distributed netcode. Refer to `NETCODE.md`. |
| `cache/cache_files.c` | When a map's tags load and unload, the port finds the bitmaps that the high-res HUD replaces (`game/hud_hires_tags.c`), and adds the tags of the menus to the menus' map (`game/menu_tags.c`). |
| `interface/ui_widget.c`, `interface/ui_widget_event_handler_functions.c`, `interface/ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c` | The main menu is the PC version's from `port/assets/menus` (`display.menus`); the menus' widgets can call the port's functions (`game/menu_functions.c`) and send the PC version's custom activation event; the widgets' memory is 256 KB, not 16 KB; the main menu and Multiplayer clear co-op's controllers, so that a gamepad going back to controller 1 is not a controller unplugged; the lobby's split screen players leave alone, and one who quits in game is not joined to the next game (`interface/player_ui.c`). |
| `input/input_abstraction.c`, `game/player_control.c`, `game/players.c`, `game/player_queues_new.c`, `units/units.h` | The keyboard and mouse's actions (`src/xinput_sdl.c`, `include/halo_keyboard.h`) join controller 1's game controls; their reload key reloads on its own, and their action key only acts (a control flag of the port's, sent with the player's action, stops the reload the controller's X falls back to). |
| `sound/sound_manager.c`, `interface/hud.c`, `game/game_engine.c` | The music's and the other sounds' volumes; the HUD's and the scoreboard's settings are read again when Settings changes them. |
| `rasterizer/xbox/rasterizer_xbox_shadows.c` | With larger shadow maps (`display.shadow_resolution`), the blur's taps stay half a texel apart, and more passes widen it to cover the same part of the map as on the Xbox. |
| `render/render.c` | The 3D view of each window is antialiased before the HUD is drawn (`display.anti_aliasing`). |
| `interface/hud.c` | In multiplayer, players' names are drawn above their heads (`display.player_names`, `display.player_name_scale`). |
| `rasterizer/rasterizer_text.c`, `text/draw_string.c` | Text is drawn from an atlas of the fonts' glyphs, rasterized at the resolution the game draws at (`src/text_hires.c`), when the font has every character of the string. Text can be drawn scaled about a point (`rasterizer_text_set_scale`), as the players' names are. Each glyph's advance is centred on the font tag character's, so the layout is the same, and a glyph is cut at a text box only where the font tag's character visibly was. |

The x86 inline assembly of the game is replaced by C. Thus the compiler
can optimize that code for each processor:

| File | Assembly | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cseries/cseries.h` | x87 `fistp` (`fast_ftol`) | `__builtin_rint` |
| `bitmaps/bitmaps_inlines.h` | x87 conversions | C conversions |
| `math/matrix_math.c` | SSE `matrix4x3_multiply` | a C loop |
| `effects/decals.c` | an x87 conversion | a C conversion |
| `cseries/profile.c` | `rdtsc` | `QueryPerformanceCounter` |
| `cseries/cseries.c` | naked `stristr` | a C `stristr` |
| `cseries/stack_walk_windows.c` | a read of EBP | `__builtin_frame_address` |
| `interface/hud_draw.c` | a read of `[ebp+4]` | `__builtin_return_address(1)` |
| `bink/bink_playback.c` | `int 3` | `__builtin_trap` |

The x87 control and status words (`_control87`, `_statusfp`, `_clearfp` in
`src/msvc_crt.c`) use `fenv.h`. On Android, they use the FPCR and FPSR.
