/*
HALO_KEYBOARD.H

The keyboard and mouse's own controls (port/linux/src/xinput_sdl.c): in the
game they do not drive the first controller, as they do in the menus, but
the player's actions themselves, by the bindings in config.toml's
[controls] (Settings > Controls Setup changes them). The game takes them
with the first controller's (source/input/input_abstraction.c), so the
profile's button layout is the controller's alone, and reloading has a key
of its own (source/game/player_control.c).
