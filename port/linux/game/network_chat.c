/*
NETWORK_CHAT.C

The text chat of network games (port/linux/NETCODE.md), as the PC version
had it: T (controls.chat) starts a line to everyone, Y (controls.team_chat)
one to the player's team; Tab, while typing, turns it to everyone, the team
or the vehicle in turn; Enter sends it, Escape lets it go. A controller's
D-pad Up (the touch controls' too) opens an on-screen keyboard instead,
whose keys the stick moves through and A types, a tap types (the
touchscreen), and the controller then drives nothing else (xinput_sdl.c's
halo_chat_pad_buttons, halo_chat_taps). The lines are
drawn above the motion sensor, at half the HUD font's size, each with its
player's name in their team's colour, wrapped to a column a little over half
the view wide, and fade after a while; where the motion sensor is not drawn
(its player dead), where it was last drawn in a view of that size. While a
line is typed, Page Up and Page Down (and the mouse wheel) scroll back through
the last CHAT_MAXIMUM_LINES. Where the touch controls hold the bottom left
(Android, and a browser whose touch controls are used), they go at the top
left under the weapon's panel, the newest highest, at the font's own size. Each local player's view shows the lines that
player hears; the first local player types, and their view shows the line
being typed (its end, when it is wider than the column). No line is typed or
shown in a menu, a cinematic, or while the HUD is hidden, and the lines of a
game are let go when the next starts.

A client sends its line to the host (_distributed_message_chat_up,
reliably), which takes it only from the client's own stream, from one of
that machine's players, at most CHAT_BURST lines at once and one each
CHAT_REFILL_MILLISECONDS after (a machine new to its slot starting afresh),
its text cut to printable ASCII ("|", which the game's text drawing takes
for the start of a code, becomes "?"). The host
sends it on to every machine that hears it (_distributed_message_chat_down,
reliably): all of them, a team's line only those with a player of the
team (every machine in a game without teams), and a vehicle's line only
those with a player riding in the vehicle the sender rides in (the
outermost: a vehicle on another's back is its), whatever the map's vehicles
are, and the sender's own. A client shows only what the
host sends, its own lines too, so every machine shows the same lines in the
same order; it takes the host's lines and settings only over the host's
connection's stream, which no other machine can send as the host. A build
without the chat drops the three kinds as unknown: its players neither send
nor see lines.

The host's settings (network.text_chat: on, links allowed, or off; off in a
game a player hosts that is listed in the server browser) go to every
client (_distributed_message_chat_config). A line they refuse is refused by
its sender's machine and again by the host, which tells the sender why; a
client without them (from a host without the chat) has the chat off. A
client in a public game it joined from the server browser has the chat off
whatever the host says (a changed host could turn it on): it takes no line
from it and sends none. A dedicated server is the exception on both sides
(chat_listing_allows): its network.text_chat holds when it is listed, and
a client that joined it from a master server's list (an approved
operator's, by its key, not the listing's own word) follows it.
display.text_chat hides the chat on this machine.

The host may type "/mute <player> [minutes]" (20 when it gives none, a day
at most) or "/unmute <player>", the player as the console's kick finds one
(the whole name in either case, else the one it begins). It keeps the mute
by the player's name, in either case (the host keeps players' names apart
in either case), which then sends no line further than the host till
the minutes are up (or the host unmutes it) and is told for how long; every
machine is told of each mute and unmute, a line of the host's alone in the
chat (_chat_line_notice_bit). A client's /mute is not sent: only the host
mutes.
