/*
MAP_SHARE.C

Custom Edition maps shared over network games (map_share.h,
port/linux/NETCODE.md "Map sharing").

A client joining a game on a map it does not have asks the host, over its
connection (_distributed_message_map_share_request: the level, and which
of its files it lacks: the map, bitmaps.map, sounds.map, loc.map). A host
that shares maps (network.map_share) hashes them (map_share_files.c) and
answers with each file's size and hash (_offer), and which of the game's
other machines may have them (_sources, again every few seconds: they are
the tracker's). The client then fetches the files from all of them at once,
as a torrent's peers do, over connections of their own on MAP_SHARE_PORT:

- each end says which files it has, whole or by piece, and tells the other
  of each piece it gets;
- the client asks for the rarest pieces first, a few at a time from each,
  and checks each against its hash (the pieces' hashes come from any of
  them: they are checked against the file's hash, the host's word); a
  machine that sends a wrong piece is not asked again;
- a machine sends what it has of the game's files (its map, the resource
  maps the map needs, a download's pieces) no faster than its limit
  (network.map_share_upload for the host, network.map_seed_upload for the
  others, network.map_seed turning that off), so the game's own traffic
  keeps the rest of the upload.

Over the internet the players reach their host alone: the host also says how
another player is reached (its key's hash), and a player asks that one for a
session as it asked the host (p2p.c: a player answers holders of the invite
it joined with while it may share). Each downloaded file is written beside
the others as <name>.part and renamed when whole (a .part found again is
checked piece by piece and taken up where it was), into custom_maps under
the map's own name, or, beside another version of that name, the name and
its hash's first digits (the game's map version is checked against the
offered map's hash).

A machine still downloading does not hold the lobby: the machines that
have the map start, and it joins the game in progress once the download is
done. The host does not drop a machine that says it is downloading, while
what it says it has grows.
