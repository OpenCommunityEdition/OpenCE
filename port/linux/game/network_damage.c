/*
NETWORK_DAMAGE.C

The distributed netcode's damage (port/linux/NETCODE.md, stage 5, and what
being hit looks and feels like on the clients).

- The host deals all damage. Every tick it sends its clients the damage it
  dealt to units: whom, with what, from where, how much, and to what
  effect. A client replays what that damage does beside the harm (the
  host's shields and health come with the units' states): a player's
  screen flash and shake, the unit's flinch, pain sound, knockback and
  stun, the scope it was knocked out of, and whom the HUD shows it was hit
  by. A killing blow it replays whole, so that the body falls as the shot
  had it and the kill is announced with the host's killer (an actor's, no
  player's, counted by no one there).
- A client deals no damage itself. What its own players' shots, grenades,
  melee and vehicles hit it reports to the host, which deals it once it has
  checked it: the report is of that machine's player, the damage one that
  player's weapons (now or lately), a grenade the host saw them throw
  (each throw's explosion once) or the vehicle they drove deal, of the
  shape the game gives it (at a point, a melee blow from the
  striker, a collision from the vehicle), the target about where the host
  had it when the shooter saw it (the host keeps a second of where
  players' units and vehicles were, and looks back as far as the report
  was made: the host's tick the client had last heard of then; one older
  than that second is refused, as a burst of reports held back is), a
  melee blow from where the host had the player and the target within
  their reach, a collision from where the host had their vehicle, the
  impact at the target, and no more reports than the weapon that deals
  them fires (an explosion's hits are one, each object hit once). What the
  shooter saw hit, hits. The host's own copies of a client's projectiles
  deal nothing (the client's report does), unless that client has left
  the game.
- The damage to a unit goes to the machines of the players it concerns
  (the unit's, its riders', the damage's owner's) and those sent the
  unit's player this tick, which see it; a killing blow to all.
- Scenery and devices that can be destroyed (lights, panels) are the
  map's, at the same index on every machine. A client reports its hits on
  them like any other, and every client deals the host's damage to its own
  copy, which breaks and plays its effects as the host's did.
