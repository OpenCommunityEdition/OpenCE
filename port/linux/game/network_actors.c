/*
NETWORK_ACTORS.C

AI sync (port/linux/NETCODE.md).

Only the host runs the AI (game.c skips ai_update on clients). An actor
drives its unit the way a player does, through unit_control. The clients
have the units (network_objects.c); this file makes them move like the
host's.

Each tick the host records the control every actor gave its unit (a hook
in unit_control, and the bursts it holds the trigger for) and sends it to
each client with the unit's state: position, seat, shields and health,
camouflage, and whether it flees in a panic. Units near a client's players
are sent every tick, others less often, but a unit starting a one-tick
action (a jump, a grenade) goes to everyone that tick. Each tick a client
feeds the latest control into unit_control, the same path that drives a
remote player's unit, so the unit walks, aims, fires and throws as it does
on the host. The state corrects any drift.

What the AI starts once is numbered, so a client plays each once however
many times it receives it: animation impulses (dives, vaults), melee
attacks and leaps (which the AI starts directly, not through the control),
speech, and custom animations (outside co-op, whose events carry them).
Pain and death sounds aren't sent: a client plays those itself as it
replays the host's damage.

A client creates no actors of its own (actors.c): the host's are the only
ones. Deaths need nothing here: network_damage.c kills a client's copy of
an AI unit the same way it kills a player's.
