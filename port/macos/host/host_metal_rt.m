/*
HOST_METAL_RT.M

World-space ray tracing for the macOS port's lighting
(port/linux/src/raytrace_gl.c), with Metal's ray tracing: in compute on
M1 and M2, in the GPU's ray tracing hardware on M3 and later.

- The level: port/linux/game/raytrace_world.c gives the active BSP's
  collision surfaces as triangles (host_rt_set_world), and they become a
  Metal acceleration structure, rebuilt when the BSP changes.
- The frame: the guest draws each pixel's linear depth and normal into a
  texture it shares with Metal (host_rt_texture: a Metal texture that
  ANGLE, which draws the game on the same Metal device, takes as a GL
  texture through EGL_ANGLE_metal_texture_client_buffer).
- The rays (host_rt_trace): from each pixel's point in the world, four rays
  over the hemisphere around its normal, which find the level's geometry
  near it wherever it is, on screen or not (ambient occlusion), and one
  along the view's reflection, whose hit is projected back onto the screen
  for its colour if the camera sees it there. The results go to a second
  shared texture, which the guest composites.

GL and Metal take turns on the GPU, through a Metal shared event
(EGL_ANGLE_metal_shared_event_sync): GL signals it when the depth and
normals are drawn, the rays wait for that and signal it when done, and GL
waits for that before it reads the results. The CPU waits for neither, so
it prepares the next frame while the GPU traces. Without the extension,
glFinish before the rays and the command buffer completed before GL
reads the results.
